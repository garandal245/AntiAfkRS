# AntiAfkRS

Automatically moves mouse in zone with coordinates provided in set time  has options of pressing right click then escape to cause a mouse interaction and then escape to close and possibly opened context menu 


My first real rust program 

Might be usefull to someone but probably isnt.

compared to my python version i think this was made better but i dont like how the mouse movement works using smoothmove from autopilot crate
